# EASY HIIT TIMER ⏱️🔥

A lightweight, visually engaging High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) timer built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a "Party Mode" that uses rhythmic audio and visual flashes to keep your adrenaline pumping during work sets.

## 🚀 Features

* **Customizable Intervals:** Set your own Work time, Rest time, and Total Rounds.
* **Party Mode Intensity:**
    * During "Work" phases, the screen pulses with a red flow effect.
    * Rhythmic audio beeps play based on your selected speed level (generated via Web Audio API).
* **Always On:** Uses the **Screen Wake Lock API** to prevent your phone from sleeping during the workout.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Modern, responsive design that looks good on mobile and desktop.
* **Zero Dependencies:** No frameworks, no external libraries, no image assets. Just pure code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Keyframe Animations, Variables, Backdrop Filter)
* **JavaScript** (ES6+, Web Audio API, Wake Lock API)

## 📦 How to Use

1.  Download or copy the code into an `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox).
3.  **Configure your workout:**
    * **Work/Rest:** Adjust seconds using the +/- buttons.
    * **Rounds:** Set total number of sets.
    * **Speed:** Controls the tempo of the audio beeps during the work phase (Lv 1-5).
